Neither carhailing nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the carhailing Platform or Collective Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) from the use of or inability to use the carhailing Platform or Collective Content, (iii) from any communications, interactions or meetings with other Members or other persons with whom you communicate, interact or meet with as a result of your use of the carhailing Platform, or (iv) from your publishing or booking of a Ride, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not carhailing has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between carhailing and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
